#+description: wrapper script for byzanz


* Introduction

This is a Emacs wrapper for "byzanz-record - small screen cast creator".
Created by Benjamine Otte. By using the window you are currently using
and type =M-x byzanz-record= which is an interactive function. The
function needs three arguments which will be asked for:

   * output-filename :: the file to be created <file>.[gif|webm|flv|ogg,ogv]
   * duration :: duration of the recording (in seconds)
   * delay :: delay before start recording (in seconds) 

After the initial delay, the record start (of the selected window) for
the duration provided.

Here is a real simple example output.
